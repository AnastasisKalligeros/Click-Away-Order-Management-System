WEB application that serves the Click Away service for a football team's boutique. The application includes the products of each store, together with their available stock. Each customer can order the product, but also using Geolocation Services can be served temporally and spatially (when and in which area). Each store can identify an incoming customer and the products that correspond to him/her, based on the current location of the customer.
